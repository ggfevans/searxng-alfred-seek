I just setup my own personal Search engine using SearXNG at https://search.falcon-wahoo.ts.net/

I want to further improve my setup and integrate it with Alfred (launcher) in macOS with Alfred-SearXNG-Workflow.


Inspired by https://github.com/chrisgrieser/gitfred which is a github search workflow for Alfred. I want to do things like show inline search results inside of the Alfred interface
